### [CitiBike Mapper](http://nycbikemapper.herokuapp.com/) gives you directions to the nearest available CitiBike and will drop you off your CitiBike at the closest available dock to your destination.

##### External Data: CitiBike's live [station feed](http://citibikenyc.com/stations/json). This feed is updated every minute by CitiBike. It will also be refreshed in the users browser every minute. 

##### Front End : JavaScript, Google Maps API v3. 

##### Back End  : Ruby on Rails. The only back end logic is a method to get the citibike JSON object. Hopefully they allow cross browser requests in the future.

##### Next features: 
1. Convert to iPhone and Android app using PhoneGap
2. Use Google Maps AutoComplete functionaility for text boxes
